Releasing a movie during a Long Weekend (LW) is the best time (season) to, as this has the highest average box office collections. This might be due to the fact that people have more free time to go watch movies during long weekends, and this can be the reason increasing the revenue generated by the movie, ultimately taking it to the box office collections. Another good time to release a movie is during Festive Seasons (FS), as people tend to spend more time with family and watching movies is a common way of doing so.

## Averages
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de74ee6e-a50d-4245-b892-a371a1c2ac11)

Average Budget:
- Without Item Song – 23.98 crores
- With Item Song – 37.29 crores

Average Box Office Collection:
- Without Item Song – 37.93 crores
- With Item Song – 81.25 crores

Movies that have Item Songs tend to have a higher budget. This might be because of extra costs like production, fees, choreography and others. Movies with Item Songs also perform substantially better in the box office collections. This means that Item Songs help in attracting more viewers.

Item Songs do make a difference to the budgets and box office collections; if the objective is to keep costs low it would be better to not have Item Songs in the movie, but if the goal is to maximise box office revenue, then it is advisable to include Item Songs in the movie.

## Correlation Coefficients:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d22bbb16-16db-4049-995f-eac1d881db67)

- Youtube Views and Box Office Collections: 0.59
- Youtube Likes and Box Office Collections: 0.68
- Youtube Dislikes and Box Office Collections: 0.62

We can see a decent positive correlation between Youtube metrics and Box Office Collections. This tells us that higher values in these metrics would likely result in higher box office revenue. The most relevant of these metrics is Youtube Likes. This means that Youtube metrics have a significant impact on a movie’s revenues. Engagement is key.

## Average Box Office Collection Revenues:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cd80911-47b1-4f2c-80b6-abfefa8b1940)

- Category A (Top-tier Actors): 115.78 crores
- Category B (Mid-tier Actors): 34.76 crores
- Category LK (Lesser-Known Actors): 14.41 crores

We can see that there is clear difference in the revenue of movies based on the actors, where the top-tier actors outperform the mid and lesser-known actors that star in movies. This shows the importance of selecting the lead actors of a movie, because of the direct correlation actors have with the performance of the movie.

## Average Budget by Content type:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44f2e2c5-eba0-4cca-b30a-ab4305d3a53b)

- Art: 18.00 crores
- Biography: 13.57 crores
- Book / Novel: 36.00 crores
- Masala: 29.07 crores
- Prequel / Sequel: 41.82 crores
- Remake: 37.50 crores
- Satire: 26.00 crores
- Social Subject: 24.00 crores

We can see that the budgets vary depending on the type of movie being produced, movies that are more complex like sequels require more budgets as they require more efforts in production and marketing. Genres like Art and Biography have much lower budgets as they are a very niche and don’t generate as much revenue. There is significant difference in the budgets of different types of movies.

# Analysis
1) The budget required for an equal chance of box office success or failure is 98.43 crores.
2) Since the p-value, 0.36 is greater than the 0.05 level of significance, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

   H0: There is no significant evidence.

   This means that there isn’t significant evidence to conclude that higher-budgets are more likely to fail at the box office collections. Movie budgets are not statistically significant in predicting the success/failure.
   
4) The probability of success for a movie with the budget of 100 crores is, 50.21%.
5) Confusion Matrix:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/085c2843-1805-4101-a233-47800b239c02)

Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

Sensitivity = 4 / (4 + 3)

Sensitivity = 0.57 (57.14%)

The model correctly identified approximately 57.14% of movies that were successful. This is moderately low, indicating the model is not very effective in detecting true success in movies.

Specificity = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives)

Specificity = 85 / (85 + 57)

Specificity = 0.60 (59.86%)

The model correctly identified approximately 59.86% of failures in movies. This is moderately low, indicating that the model is not very effective at identifying failures.

## Success Probability:
- Movie with an item song: 47.54%.
- Movie without an item song: 36.36%.
- Difference between the success probabilities: 11.18%.

We already know that movies that have Item Songs are given higher budgets and have a higher average at the Box Office Collections. The above probabilities support this further as we can see a 11.18% increase in the chance of success of the movie has an Item Song. This suggests that movies with Item Songs attract more views and generate more revenue, and this may lead to the movie being a success.
## McFadden R-squared values:
- Item Song Model: 0.0092
- Budget Model: 0.0041

This means that the Item Song Model can explain 0.92% of the variance, and the Budget Model can explain 0.41% of the variance. Overall, the Item Song Model is performing better at explaining the variance in the data (Success/Failure), when compared to the Budget Model. The Item Song Model has a slightly lower p-value than the Budget Model which can indicate that it has more of an impact on the movie success. Both models have coefficients that are not statistically significant. And, both the models have pretty low R-squared values; which means that there are other factors that would help us explain more of the variance in the data.

## Possible Reasons:
- Both the predictors in the models (Item Song and Budget), are weak predictors of success of a movie by themselves.
- There may not be enough data points for the model to better capture the influence of the predictors.
- Like mentioned before, both models only have one predictor and may benefit from having more predictor variables to explain a larger chunk of the variance.

# Model Analysis
## Model 1: Logistic Regression model with all variables
Issues: The model had issues with converging, this means that the model was unable to find the optimal parameters while fitting the data. Due to this, the model is unusable for predictive purposes as it has failed to converge while training itself.

Model Evaluation:
- Accuracy: 0.73
- Kappa: 0.285

While the accuracy score of the model is moderately high, the Kappa Score indicates that the model is worse than random chance (50/50), and that there is room for improvement.

## Model 2: Logistic Regression model with most significant variables
The most significant predictors:
- Movie_Content
- Earning_Ratio
- Box_Office_Collection(in crores)
- Profit(in crores)
- Youtube_Likes

Issues: This model also failed to converge.

Model Evaluation:
- Accuracy: 0.94
- Kappa: 0.75

While having a much higher accuracy, this model also has a much higher Kappa Score which indicates that it is significantly better than random chance. Despite having issues with converging, this model has performed pretty well on the test dataset.

## Model 3: Decision Tree Model with all the variables
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba003a68-f1ba-4a9a-84b7-d44bec820bdc)

This model was made to find the importance of each variable in predicting the success of the movies.

Variable Importance:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfbc4e3b-d818-4771-9c9f-5506ccfa708a)

Earning_Ratio being the more important and Movie_Content being the least important.

## Model 4: Decision Tree model with important variables
The predictors in this model were chosen from the importance scores of predictors from the previous decision tree model.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3590813c-2d39-42d5-9cb2-43ece143a96a)

Confusion Matrix Analysis:
- Accuracy: 100% - This indicates that the model predicted all instances accurately.
- Sensitivity: 100% - This indicated that the model predicted all successes accurately.
- Specificity: - 

Although the model has a full score on accuracy, it does not make it a good model. Some issues with the model:
- The decision tree model fails to count the failure data points as failures.
- Because of this, as we can see all the instances in the test data are counted as successes, hence the model could not be tested on the failure of a movie.

Rules that can be used to predict the success of a movie:
- If the Earning_Ratio is higher than 1.5 then the movie is a success.

We can only have one definitive rule based on the model, as there are issues with the data handeling by the model. Other factors to look out for, not as a set rule are the important factors. 

- Profit(in crores): Higher profits
- Youtube_Likes: More likes
- Movie_Content: Popular genres
